When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A) Working from multiple computers, having multiple users share code, keeping data backed up & secure

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A) Manual - more control (logical changes), Auto - no control (random)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A) fork - don't know the other programmer/not collaborating/want to change someone's code without affecting
original files....clone - copy and work locally....branch - experiment, etc.
