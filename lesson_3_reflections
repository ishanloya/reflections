When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A) Working from multiple computers, having multiple users share code, keeping data backed up & secure

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A) Manual - more control (logical changes), Auto - no control (random)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A) fork - don't know the other programmer/not collaborating/want to change someone's code without affecting
original files....clone - copy and work locally....branch - experiment, etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A) If one needs to work offline, it's helpful

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A) Using Google Docs/manually I suppose...easier - easy of use...harder - collaboration

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A) When I don't want to modify/break my production version/work on a new feature/experiment
Modifying the mester keeps things simpler whereas new branches offer more flexibility
